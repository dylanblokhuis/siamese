## How to setup development on Windows

To run the app you need to set the MPV_DIR variable, see `.env.example` on how you can create a suitable `.env` file.

### 1. Download mpv player from SourceForge

https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/libmpv/

### 2. Extract downloaded contents to a folder

### 3. Point `MPV_DIR` to the folder e.g. `C:\\Users\\user\\Downloads\\mpv`
